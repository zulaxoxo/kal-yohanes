# Welcome to our tutorials

This is a small collection of tutorials for physics students that introduce you
to a number of different topics that you could encounter. All the numerical calculation etc will be done in [python](https://www.python.org/) as the standard language. A nice tutorial is this a [A byte of Python](https://python.swaroopch.com/).
